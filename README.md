# Backup of Blog

This is just a backup of my blog posts from [Medium](https://www.medium.com/@pyan) in markdown format.

Wanna have this on here for easy reference and possible copying over different publications. Most of the big tech publications on Medium has moved to their own independent websites now.

### [Makers Academy BootCamp](https://makers.tech/)
