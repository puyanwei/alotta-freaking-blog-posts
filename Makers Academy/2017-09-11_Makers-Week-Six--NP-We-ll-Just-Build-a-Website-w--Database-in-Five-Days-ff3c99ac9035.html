Especially with limited experience! lol</p><p name="6146" id="6146" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Last week we did our first project as a group, and with our weird prime numbered cohort my group became a five, whilst all others were put into fours. I’m not sure if that gave us a significant advantage, but it was a bit of a hindrance splitting the group up, it was either a 3–2 or a 2–2–1 formation. But like any football manager (I assume?) we were flexible according to what was needed on the “pitch”.</p><figure name="d6c3" id="d6c3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 640px; max-height: 480px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*TIBxpZvFbFY4Teqg.jpg" data-width="640" data-height="480" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TIBxpZvFbFY4Teqg.jpg"></div></figure><p name="93e7" id="93e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Our first white board!

This meant having a sign up/login page, and once in users were able to put up their room for rent, and book existing rooms on the feed.</p><p name="8a16" id="8a16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had a choice to use Javascript or Ruby, and surprisingly only two people wanted to use Ruby. So far we’ve had 9 weeks of using Ruby, one week of Javascript, and it seems Ruby didn’t stand a chance. For me Javascript is very familiar to me, and I like the flexibility it has with the web, so its popularity surprised me.</p><p name="03d5" id="03d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">PLANNING WAS EVERYTHING</strong></p><p name="9445" id="9445" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right from the get go our team was super organised, we were very open to the morning stand ups, and the retros. A stand up is a reflection on the previous day, a plan for the current day, and a way to bring up any concerns to the group. A retrospective is a meeting that happens at the end of the day to write on the whiteboard things that were good, bad and confusing.</p><figure name="dbab" id="dbab" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 640px; max-height: 480px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*bdCx24rx_b587AMg.jpg" data-width="640" data-height="480" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bdCx24rx_b587AMg.jpg"></div></figure><p name="27bf" id="27bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Our first retrospective!</p><p name="03e4" id="03e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spending some time put aside for these things really made things clearer for the group. It was also a great way to make sure that we had good communication.</p><p name="827c" id="827c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Early on we identified the things we needed to do, and delegated other things we wanted to research. A priority was working out what we needed to use, then set up the environment with those softwares, and then set up a skeleton file structure that can be pushed to <a href="http://www.github.com/" data-href="http://www.github.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">github</a> that everyone could access.</p><figure name="fcb6" id="fcb6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 240px; max-height: 320px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ux7JDBzb20skFmXL.jpg" data-width="240" data-height="320" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ux7JDBzb20skFmXL.jpg"></div></figure><p name="ce7e" id="ce7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">File setup planning</p><figure name="2f77" id="2f77" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 320px; max-height: 240px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*D8kooxdNsRNupPKy.jpg" data-width="320" data-height="240" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*D8kooxdNsRNupPKy.jpg"></div></figure><p name="58dd" id="58dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Page direction planning</p><p name="1e81" id="1e81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was clear that we needed to have a database for our users to sign in with, as well as for the rooms to be rented or put up to rent. We already has used <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" data-href="https://www.postgresql.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Postgres</a> for database stuff before so that seemed like a good obvious choice. However, we had heard bad things about the ORM, which is used to link the database to our website. I had heard the name <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" data-href="https://www.mongodb.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> floating around and after some research we realised that it works with hashes, which makes it more adaptable to Javascript (which is essentially hashes).</p><figure name="e5ce" id="e5ce" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 640px; max-height: 276px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 43.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*airFbEoyRk-oh9Re.png" data-width="640" data-height="276" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*airFbEoyRk-oh9Re.png"></div></figure><p name="97ea" id="97ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Using Trello is a great project management tool</p><h3 name="9ce8" id="9ce8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">ROLLERCOASTERING OUR WAY TO SUCCESS</h3><p name="49a2" id="49a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As well as having meetings at the beginning and the end of the day, we also chose to do one after lunch. This was to check in on everyone and see how things were going. On multiple occasions we decided to switch strategies from looking at one thing, and then prioritizing something else. Or if a group member wanted to change up and get more stuck in then we would mix it up. Our group was fantastically open about being flexible which was awesome.</p><p name="7da9" id="7da9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Major points of contentions;</p><p name="3c8c" id="3c8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Lows;</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b383" id="b383" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">First day is naturally a lot of reading, watching tutorials, and research.
