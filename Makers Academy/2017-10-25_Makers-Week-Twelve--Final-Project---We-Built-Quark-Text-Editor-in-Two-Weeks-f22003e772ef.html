However yesterday I was doing my applications for Makers Careers Fair jobs and the deadline was today.</p><h3 name="f89f" id="f89f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">REACHING THE MVP</h3><p name="9d04" id="9d04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When starting a big project like this, we have been taught that the best approach is to make an MVP and use that as your first stepping stone. A Minimum Viable Product is the most bare bones minimal amount of your product that you can do. So for us, creating a text editor, it would be have something where we can write text on.</p><p name="f935" id="f935" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things were not as simple as it seemed because we needed to test first, and we had no idea what we were meant to use for testing, let along how it works and how the syntax was written.</p><p name="c49d" id="c49d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Electron documentation said that Spectron was the official testing framework, so we tried to use that. However it was quite difficult in finding the elements on our page. The typical “document.getElementId()” which did exactly that didn’t seem to work, because our app did not call them documents, it was called something else.</p><p name="133c" id="133c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once we did figure it out, it was Wednesday (we aimed to get it done by Tuesday), and there was high fives all round and a huge sigh of relief.</p><figure name="b75b" id="b75b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 328px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 54.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*GDtTGT50xmj_Oc9i.gif" data-width="600" data-height="328" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GDtTGT50xmj_Oc9i.gif"></div></figure><p name="b4e6" id="b4e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What testing with Spectron looks like!</p><h3 name="6e21" id="6e21" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">CRUD &amp; LS</h3><p name="ca00" id="ca00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After that, we realised that we would have to include some CRUD functionality. CRUD is another technical acronym that basically stands for “Create, Read, Update, Delete”. It is a way of explaining the most common basic functionalities of all programs.</p><p name="d2b9" id="d2b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Including CRUD was difficult, as it was part of Node JS but again like many other things, we had never used it before. We would be using a module within Node called “LS” that let us move and work with files and directories.</p><p name="6277" id="6277" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We managed to incorporate a folder tree as well on the side. This was done by having LS look at our current directory, loop through it and put it in a list.</p><p name="829e" id="829e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An interesting feature of Electron is that it doesn’t have copy/paste shortcuts unless you explicitly add it in. This made is quite difficult to try and debug our problems as without it made it much longer to type in everything to check our app!</p><p name="c873" id="c873" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was quite unclear as to how or where to incorporate it into our app. When it came to testing, it was rather problematic because Spectron did not seem to have the ability to click on prompt boxes when you wanted to imitate a save or load.</p><h3 name="c7a9" id="c7a9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">THE CURSED CURSOR</h3><p name="85a8" id="85a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Probably the most time spent on anything was trying to get our cursor to behave the way we wanted it. There became deja-vu type memorise of the dreaded <a href="https://medium.com/@pyan/apostrophe-apocalypse-b375158e6b41" data-href="https://medium.com/@pyan/apostrophe-apocalypse-b375158e6b41" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">apostrophe</a> again, but to this that was nothing in comparison.</p><p name="31e1" id="31e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bane of our existence, for this project!</p><p name="9708" id="9708" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What was happening was that on every keystroke we applied <a href="http://prismjs.com/" data-href="http://prismjs.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prism.js</a>, which was our syntax code highlighter. This library looked at the text, and through looking at the various patterns it would be able to recognise which coding language was being written.</p><p name="f2f8" id="f2f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, everytime we ran this program and then told the cursor to go back to the editor afterwards, it would always return back to the top left. This meant that it would always end up typing backwards!</p><figure name="c102" id="c102" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 338px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*LfsxMVs-F3Mb9UsM.gif" data-width="600" data-height="338" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LfsxMVs-F3Mb9UsM.gif"></div></figure><p name="9ae3" id="9ae3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We probably spent over a third of our time trying to figure a workaround to this problem. The worst case scenario would be that we would just have button on the page that you could click instead.</p><p name="5a09" id="5a09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Day 8 (its a 10 day project!), we got a breakthrough and got it to work! We had to have code to keep track of the cursor’s position, then when it got reset move it back to where it was. Its quite amazing to see the final product how it looks like nothing is happening! But so much blood, sweat and tears went into solving this bug!</p><figure name="369f" id="369f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 400px; max-height: 281px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 70.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*TprElgzUYgPv8kJ5.png" data-width="400" data-height="281" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TprElgzUYgPv8kJ5.png"></div></figure><p name="6e82" id="6e82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We used Trello to help us organise our project. That syntax bug on the todo list for so long!</p><h3 name="f06b" id="f06b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">FINAL PRESENTATION</h3><p name="d4ad" id="d4ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It was really amazing to see how we managed to pull things through last minute. I mean, we were super last minute! The demo video was shot like 2 hours before the final presentation, we had to fix a lot of bugs the night before, so shooting the video became very late.</p><p name="09ad" id="09ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I felt bad for my colleague, who was in charge of presenting the demo because he had nothing to work with which made it difficult to practice. We probably did about 10 different recordings before we were happy and then I had to edit it on iMovie and upload it to slides.com.</p><p name="3b2d" id="3b2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a 90 second clip, for no apparent reason apart from being totally trolled, iMovie seemed to want to take like 20 minutes to render the clip!</p><p name="3eac" id="3eac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The presentation went really well, it was great to not only see our group do so well, but the whole cohort step up with their projects too! Its quite strange to finally have our own final project be shown, since I’ve been to about four graduations, but I’m honoured to have been a part of this, and also be the last cohort to only have one coach.</p><p name="c548" id="c548" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are the projects from Blue-July Cohort 2017!</p><p name="332d" id="332d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">QUARK TEXT EDITOR</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">— </strong>A much, much smaller version of Atom (get it?), text editor for writing code.
