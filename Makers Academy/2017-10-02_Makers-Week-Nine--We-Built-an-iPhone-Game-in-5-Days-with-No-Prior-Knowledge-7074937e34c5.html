We came up with a bunch of ideas, rounded them down and then got given our our groups, and then within it we picked one of them to do;</p><h3 name="c3ef" id="c3ef" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">P-YAN AN IDEAS MAN?</h3><p name="d6f5" id="d6f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’ve always prided myself on being an ideas guy. Its the execution i’m lacking in. So when the time came for us to submit our ideas I kinda felt that I should be able to get one through. Each student picked 3 and then they got rounded down.</p><figure name="e65a" id="e65a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 400px; max-height: 243px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 60.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*qzekDt2AKjAEmAM0.jpg" data-width="400" data-height="243" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qzekDt2AKjAEmAM0.jpg"></div></figure><p name="cfc1" id="cfc1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure">“DING!”</p><p name="f990" id="f990" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My ‘strategy’ was to pick something that was general enough to be open, but also have a specific thing in mind that could be cool. I think good ideas at this stage can be broken down by answering the following questions;</p><ul class="postList"><li name="a4bf" id="a4bf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Is there a particular thing you’d like to try out and explore?</li><li name="b68a" id="b68a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">At the end of it, is it possible to have something tangible to show for it?</li></ul><p name="4f6a" id="4f6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Two outta three of my ideas got picked to the final choices, and our group unanimously agreed that we wanted to make a iPhone game. Here’s my ideas anyways, with those criteria in mind;</p><ol class="postList"><li name="1b16" id="1b16" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">iPhone game using the tilting motion</strong> — We wanted to try out making a phone app, and a game and use the gyrometer feature. And we’d have a cool app on our phone to show for it afterwards.</li><li name="0529" id="0529" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Chrome extension which funks up the pages 80s style</strong> — Could be cool to try and make a Chrome extension plugin. The Chrome extension could branch out into any other idea. At the end of it you could have something that you could share with others and let them download and install it to see for themselves what it does.</li><li name="4174" id="4174" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Machine learning pathfinder for London Underground</strong> — My weakest idea tbh, as I had already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seen it done before</a>, but thought it could be a cool thing to expand upon. But machine learning is a hot topic these days, but this idea for sure doesn’t seem to have the accessibility or fun of the other two.</li></ol><h3 name="815b" id="815b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">WHERE 2 START</h3><p name="0008" id="0008" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Starting out projects like this always seems pretty overwhelming at the beginning. The important thing is to identify what needs to be done and plan for the future;</p><p name="6f8a" id="6f8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Make a Plan!</strong> — Super important to get things going. What programs are we going to use? What is our testing framework? The first aim is to get a MVP completed, ie a Minimum Viable Product. For us, this would be a ball on the screen that would move around due to tilting the phone.</p><figure name="3825" id="3825" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 400px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Mmwo0em5d1qLs5V5.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="400" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Mmwo0em5d1qLs5V5.jpg"></div></figure><p name="dd3c" id="dd3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Original planning page from Day 1</p><p name="24cc" id="24cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ironically, Swift was chosen by our group in no time at all.

These are plans for the day and end of day evaluations. These are super useful to keep things in perspective and take a step back to remind ourselves what we’re doing.

You have to go to the Apple Developer page, sort out sign ins, and fill out forms. Once done with those, you have to do more downloads and then select an extra option on your phone to activate it once it downloads.</p><p name="10ec" id="10ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some reason, my developer account had issues where it’d never save my sign in, so I’d have to do it like every time!

Swift 4 had just been released the week before, so we thought it would be better to work with Swift 3 because there’d be more documentation on it.</p><p name="c319" id="c319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, after a few of us realising that our newly updated OS11 iPhones weren’t compatible with Swift 3, we decided to go for Swift 4. Another incentive was also the fact that after this project, if we decided to try out more apps we would have to learn Swift 4 anyways, so its more beneficial.</p><p name="6297" id="6297" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">End of day 2 we managed to finish our MVP. We found a good spaceship tutorial which used the gyroscope movement and adapted that code into ours. We found a Pokeball sprite that we could use, and so that was the beginning of our Pokemon themed game…</p><figure name="fa37" id="fa37" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 320px; max-height: 217px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 67.80000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*cnivOaLecOKvk0Vc.jpg" data-width="320" data-height="217" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cnivOaLecOKvk0Vc.jpg"></div></figure><h3 name="f8ba" id="f8ba" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">XCODE TESTING IS AWFUL</h3><p name="e841" id="e841" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">From my limited experience of checking out maybe five(?) testing frameworks, XCode’s XCTest was by far the worst.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="225d" id="225d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Interface</strong> — XCode is pretty UI intensive, meaning that you have to use their software to do everything. I found it pretty overwhelming, as they had gone completely nuts with the amount of options for everything. I’m not talking options for properties of things that you create, but the actual user interface itself! This means its not intuitive at all and just finding the tests themselves was confusing enough, let along knowing how to run them!</li></ul><figure name="fc8f" id="fc8f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 640px; max-height: 449px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 70.19999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*nLYQH7UCKkKcmyb9.png" data-width="640" data-height="449" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nLYQH7UCKkKcmyb9.png"></div></figure><p name="5d12" id="5d12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The tiny diamond button shows your tests!

The console was also quite random too, sometimes displaying a message when there was an error, and other times not showing anything. We never understood this in the end.</li><li name="0b3f" id="0b3f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Testing Games is Hard — </strong>Since the other groups also did games, this became a common theme in the groups. Most groups worked with looping frames to get the animations to interact, and so once their game started, you cannot simulate what is going on within a controlled environment. This is especially true because most games have a ton of randomness in them.</li><li name="9f98" id="9f98" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Testing Tilt Motion is Hardest — </strong>So super how do you test tilting a phone motion? XCode has a simulator phone that you can use, but after some research it was discovered that simulating the tilt on your computer is just not possible.</li></ul><figure name="a190" id="a190" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 444px; max-height: 104px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 23.400000000000002%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*1lfoZ2ZwBdjXAZD2.png" data-width="444" data-height="104" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1lfoZ2ZwBdjXAZD2.png"></div></figure><p name="10fb" id="10fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">#fml</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4b9e" id="4b9e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Record Button Saved the Day </strong>— We found a record button on day 4 lol, and that wrote down in the code what was being pressed etc. This was great because it finally gave us some insight into what the objects were called for the testing framework. With this feature, we managed to pull off some tests finding elements in our game.</li></ul><h3 name="cd0c" id="cd0c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">SMALL THINGS COUNT</h3><p name="decb" id="decb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Looking back at the <a href="https://thep-log.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/makes-week-eight-acebook-home-stretch.html" data-href="https://thep-log.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/makes-week-eight-acebook-home-stretch.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Acebook week</a>, I think we learned a lot from it actually. Adding in smaller features at a time and refactoring the code was super helpful, especially for splitting up the work between different people in the group.</p><p name="9fc8" id="9fc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When adding the enemy Team Rocket, in typical fashion they caused complete mayhem. For some reason when they appeared on top of our border, the game would instantly be over and we just couldn’t work out why.</p><figure name="79ab" id="79ab" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 320px; max-height: 219px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 68.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*if1bpaNzObutziil.jpg" data-width="320" data-height="219" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*if1bpaNzObutziil.jpg"></div></figure><p name="2828" id="2828" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Typical Team Rocket causing tons of trouble for us!</p><p name="cf2e" id="cf2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So as a purely coincidental decision nothing to do with that at all, we decided to get rid of the borders and make it an Astroids style thing where if you go left off the screen you would appear on the right, and vice versa for up and down. This actually made the game more fun!</p><figure name="7f9a" id="7f9a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 338px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*rd55MaE9pCCyMYe7yhVAsQ.gif" data-width="600" data-height="338" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rd55MaE9pCCyMYe7yhVAsQ.gif"></div></figure><p name="ae88" id="ae88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Outtakes showing our bugs!</p><p name="2a05" id="2a05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked at previous presentations and wrote a rough outline for the group to participate in. Structures are basically the same, so it was pretty easy to prepare.</p><p name="8dad" id="8dad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had also overheard that doing live tech demos are basically banned for final projects, they’re <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">always</em></strong> videos, as too many times things have gone wrong. So I insisted that we include a video.</p><p name="e015" id="e015" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was also kinda weird to think about how one would go about presenting a game which involved tilting. Showing a screenshot of the game (great timing for that new feature, Apple) would be good, but it wouldn’t show the physical tilting of the phone.</p><p name="5fe4" id="5fe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I kinda thought about having a split screen and after some quick googling I realised it was pretty easy to do in iMovie. Just needed to synch things up and it’d be great. It worked like a charm…</p><figure name="135a" id="135a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 338px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Uh_QZlclJtTjOVmi4EVixg.gif" data-width="600" data-height="338" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uh_QZlclJtTjOVmi4EVixg.gif"></div></figure><p name="9418" id="9418" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Its POKEBALL RUN!
