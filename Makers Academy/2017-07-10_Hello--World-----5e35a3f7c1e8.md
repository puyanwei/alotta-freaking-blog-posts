Hello there!

Probably the most cliche title of any programmers’ first blog post but hey, lets at least make it topical!

My name is Puyan, its nice to meet you all. I am an ex poker player from UK that has started to learn to be a programmer this year.

This blog is my therapy, to chat to you guys and get some thoughts out there. It is also a great way of documenting my life and I’m sure in the future looking back on these posts I will undoubtedly cringe, as I do so at my previous [posts](https://thep-log.blogspot.co.uk) from my old blog. I challenge myself to make a post weekly every Monday.

Currently its July my 7th month of learning Coding and am in my 2nd week of pre-course at the highly reputable [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). Next month the course will begin at location and I look forward to it intensely.

I will be making some posts on my experiences of starting out from scratch, Makers Academy and other things that tickle my fancy. I also want to make it as reader friendly as possible, which means it should be understandable to a non coder as well.

I hope that this will help you understand what it is like and possibly inspire you to make the jump if your thinking about doing it!
