Last week we switched it up to Javascript and linked that to some elements on our webpage and build an interactive thermostat with buttons and stuff.

It seems that the switch up was done to show us that learning another language isn’t as hard is its made out to be. However, I was already learning Javascript before the course started, so I guess this lesson wasn’t as applicable to me.

There’s a looooot of brackets and curly braces in Javascript!

However, comparing what I assumed was going on, having that debunked and then finding out what actually is happening really blew my mind. It kinda is like seeing this language in a whole new light. Pretty cool.

It has been interesting observing my fellow cohort members approach this. Some did extra online courses, others used youtube videos and/or looked at various documentation. Most of my classmates decided to rewrite previous projects in Javascript before moving onto the main task.

In all coding languages, they do the same core things. Store data in variables, have functions that do things, have true or false statements… and so on. Some of the newly graduated students had interviews in languages that they learned over there weekend, and still got through to the next stage. This is vs other applicants who have had years of experience in those languages… what a pisstake innit!

Our weekend challenge was to design the code for the scoreboard of ten pin bowling. Its a very confusing thing to explain, let alone code for. A strike where you clear all ten pins with one bowl is ten points plus the next two bowls, and a spare where you clear them all in two bowls you is ten points plus the next first throw. You can try it [here](http://www.bowlinggenius.com/).

See? Told you! Its like explaining the off-side trap and/or the insanely weird tennis scoring!

Check out Kingpin! Weird and funny movie

I have come to terms with testing first, then writing code. In this instance it became really helpful later on when dealing with strikes and spares. I have been totally obsessed with coding this weekend, literally getting out my laptop whenever I can on the train to London there and back, even when visiting a good friend on Sunday.

Being strict with yourself in trying to resolve problems before moving on is really tough to do, but I have been getting better at reading errors and keeping to good coding practice.

This week we’re working in groups now until the end. No more weekly challenges with pairing. We are organising ourselves with tasks each day, and making sure we have great communication. I have been looking forward to this part of the course since I love the people in my cohort so much.

Its funny that we have had 9 weeks (including the pre-course) with Ruby, one week of Javascript and when given a choice our whole cohort pretty much chose to do this week’s project in Javascript! Poor Ruby…

It will be interesting to see how far we can push ourselves. I’ve had a positive day so far, and next week I’ll report on it fully.

### EXPLODING E-CIGS ARE ABOUT!?

On Tuesday, I was on the way home and as I was walking into Euston station, a businesswoman in front of me had her bag suddenly did a mini explosion. She dropped her handbag and started running off. The handbag did a much smaller burst then stopped and it just lay there smoking.

I was pretty chill at that point thinking, “oh… that’s a weird thing… maybe its a note 8 or something”. Then I think someone shouted out bomb and everyone started running. I was pretty surprised at this and so backed off with them. It was weird how the atmosphere changed so suddenly.

It was at this point it really made me question what I saw. I was pretty saw that this wasn’t a terrorist attack or anything, but it happened so quickly that it made me question that.

The station closed down pretty promptly and I made other arrangements instead of going home, for who knows how long it would take for it to reopen.

In the end, it was reported that it was a faulty that e-cig that exploded. I had no idea that they can just spontaneously ignite like that. My friend told me that it happens quite a lot and people get some pretty bad injuries. How the hell are these things managing to pass approval for health and safety??

### FRIENDS REUNITED

Sunday I went down to London to meet a good friend I hadn’t seen in ages. He is a reporter for South Korean news, but done in English for an international audience. It was a really great catch up, also hanging out in “west \[end” again.

The west end is like Picadilly Circus area which has a lot of theatre shows around. But we used to hang out there because there were arcade machines we used to love playing, its close to tons of shops and there is a lot of cool places to eat as well. Its strange to think that even though I spent like 3 weeks living in London, I never once went there.

We hung out, and checked out some shops. I didn’t realise that Zara men’s fashion seems to perfectly tap into the wannabe Chinese Gangster look. Only then when it was pointed out to me, when I looked around there was a “gaggle” of Chinese men scouting the racks, truly considering the studded sparkly jeans or bright red boots with a zipper, with a matching red suit to go!

Do I look Chinese gangster enough?

I’m really looking forward to meeting up again, but this time in Seoul. Its all been arranged that I will be going there for a week in November. This will be fourth time I will be going, which is getting kinda close to the amount of times I’ve actually been to Hong Kong itself.

I do feel bad about leaving for November as the course has instructed that we carry our momentum of finishing to finding a job. Unfortunately this has already been planned a long time ago so I cant change it. The bad thing is that I heard that December is not a good hiring month, so it might be more realistic to find something in January.

Anyways, all this is still a while to go before it happens, hope you’re all well and happy coding, talk to u guys next week!
